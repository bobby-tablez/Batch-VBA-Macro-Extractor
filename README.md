## BATCH VBA MACRO EXTRACTOR

This script requires the installation of oletools: https://github.com/decalage2/oletools

This script can do two things to automate analysis of a large number of malicious documents:

1) rename extension-less files to any extension (VT download)
2) Process files of any desired extension: ie: doc, xls, docm, etc. 

files are then saved as .vba.txt ( to prevent accidental execution :) ) into a separate directory /extracted_vbs/ 

Disclaimer: I don't code. Feel free to fork! :)
